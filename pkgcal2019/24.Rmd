# Day 24: styler


Welcome back for the 24th and final day of the [#packagecalendar](https://twitter.com/hashtag/packagecalendar),
we are going to end in style with  [styler](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package by [Lorenz Walthert](https://twitter.com/lorenzwalthert) and [Kirill MÃ¼ller](https://twitter.com/krlmlr).

The package is available from CRAN and can be downloaded with

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("styler")
```

The goal of styler is to provide non-invasive pretty-printing of R source code while adhering to the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) formatting rules.

The package contains a handful of functions that helps you style your code at different levels.
These functions include `style_file()`, `style_dir()` and `style_pkg()` who will style files, directories and whole packages respectively.
Additionally **styler** provides Rstudio Addins for quick access.

Thank you very much for following me this year! 
It was a blast and I look forward to doing it again next year!
